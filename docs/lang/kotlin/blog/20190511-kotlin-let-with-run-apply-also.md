# 【转】Learning Kotlin：let、with、run、apply、also函数的使用

### Kotlin Receivers

Before continuing with the rest, let’s first explain what a **receiver** is in the Kotlin language, because the functions `let`, `also`, `apply`, and `run` are *extension functions* that operate on their receiver.

Nowadays, in modern Object Oriented Programming terminology, our code calls a method on an instance of a class. This executes a **function** (method) in the context of an **object** (instance of a class), usually referenced by the optional keyword `this`.

In older Object Oriented Programming parlance (Smalltalk), the function is often referred to as the **message**, while the instance is referred to as the **receiver**. The call sends the message to the receiver.

**The receiver is the object on which a function is executed** and, in Kotlin, this function can be a plain old *instance method* or it can be an *extension function*.

```kotlin
val arguments = ...
val result = arguments.apply { ... } // 'arguments' is the receiver
result.also { ... }                  // 'result' is the receiver
```

Now let’s dive into how we can choose the correct one.

### Use ‘apply’ for building or configuring objects

```kotlin
inline fun <T> T.apply(lambda: T.() -> Unit): T
```

```kotlin
typealias Bundle = HashMap<String, Any>

fun Bundle.putString(key: String, value: String) {
    this[key] = value
}

fun Bundle.putInt(key: String, value: Int) {
    this[key] = value
}

abstract class Style

data class Notification(
    val style: Style,
    val extras: Bundle
) {
    class InboxStyle : Style()
    
    class Builder(context: Any, channelID: String) {
        lateinit var style : Style
        lateinit var extras : Bundle
        
        fun build() : Notification = Notification(style, extras)
    }
}

private const val EXTRA_ID = "extra_id"
private const val EXTRA_MAX_ITEMS = "extra_max_items"
private val context = Any()
private val channel = "channel"

fun main() {
    val id = "ID"
    val maxSize = 20
    
    val extraBundle = Bundle().apply {
        putString(EXTRA_ID, id)
        putInt(EXTRA_MAX_ITEMS, maxSize)
    }

    val notification = Notification.Builder(context, channel).apply {
        style = Notification.InboxStyle()
        extras = extraBundle
    }.build()
    
    println(notification)
}
```

```bash
Notification(style=Notification$InboxStyle@2ff4acd0, extras={extra_max_items=20, extra_id=ID})
```

Uses ‘apply’ for building a Bundle and configuring a Notification Builder

The `apply` function takes a lambda-with-receiver and…

1. Provides its receiver to the lambda’s receiver
   Inside the lambda, the receiver can be used through the optional keyword `**this**`.
2. Calls the lambda
   The code in the lambda **configures or ‘builds’** the receiver.
3. Returns its receiver
   The returned value is the configured/built receiver.

### Use ‘also’ for executing side-effects on objects

```
inline fun <T> T.also(lambda: (T) -> Unit): T
```

```kotlin
typealias Bundle = HashMap<String, Any>

fun Bundle.putString(key: String, value: String) {
    this[key] = value
}

fun Bundle.putInt(key: String, value: Int) {
    this[key] = value
}

abstract class Style

data class Notification(
    val style: Style,
    val extras: Bundle
) {
    class InboxStyle : Style()

    class Builder(context: Any, channelID: String) {
        lateinit var style : Style
        lateinit var extras : Bundle

        fun build() : Notification = Notification(style, extras)
    }
}

private const val EXTRA_ID = "extra_id"
private const val EXTRA_MAX_ITEMS = "extra_max_items"

fun main() { example() }

fun example(): Notification {
    val context = Any()
    val channel = "channel"

    val id = "ID"
    val maxSize = 20


    val extraBundle = Bundle().apply {
        putString(EXTRA_ID, id)
        putInt(EXTRA_MAX_ITEMS, maxSize)
    }

    val notification = Notification.Builder(context, channel).apply {
        style = Notification.InboxStyle()
        extras = extraBundle
    }.build()
    
    return notification.also { 
        println(it)
    }
}
```

```bash
Notification(style=Notification$InboxStyle@2ff4acd0, extras={extra_max_items=20, extra_id=ID})
```

Uses ‘also’ to print the ‘notification’ object

The `also` function takes a lambda with one parameter and…

1. Provides its receiver to the lambda’s parameter
   Inside the lambda, the receiver can be used through the keyword `**it**`.
2. Calls the lambda
   The code in the lambda executes **side-effects** on the receiver. Side-effects can be logging, rendering on a screen, sending its data to storage or to the network, etc.
3. Returns its receiver
   The returned value is the receiver, but now with side-effects applied to it.

### Use ‘run’ for transforming objects

```
inline fun <T, R> T.run(lambda: T.() -> R): R
```

```kotlin
fun main() {
	val map = mapOf("key1" to 4, "key2" to 20)
    
    val logItem = map.run {
        val count = size
        val keys = keys
        val values = values
        "Map has $count keys $keys and values $values"
    }
    println(logItem)
}
```

```bash
Map has 2 keys [key1, key2] and values [4, 20]
```

Uses ‘run’ to transform the Map into a printable String of our liking

The `run` function takes a lambda-with-receiver and…

1. Provides its receiver to the lambda’s receiver
   Inside the lambda, the receiver can be used through the optional keyword `**this**`.
2. Calls the lambda and gets the its result of the lambda
   The code in the lambda **calculates a result** based on the receiver.
3. Returns the result of the lambda
   This allows the function to transform the receiver of type `T` into a value of type `R` that was returned by the lambda.

### Use ‘let’ for transforming nullable properties

```
inline fun <T, R> T.let(lambda: (T) -> R): R
```

```kotlin
class Mapper {
    val mapProperty : Map<String, Int>? = mapOf("key1" to 4, "key2" to 20)
    
    fun toLogString() : String {
        return mapProperty?.let {
            val count = it.size
            val keys = it.keys
            val values = it.values
            "Map has $count keys $keys and values $values"
        } ?: "Map is empty"
    }
}

fun main() {
    println(Mapper().toLogString())
}
```

```bash
Map has 2 keys [key1, key2] and values [4, 20]
```

Uses ‘let’ to transform the **nullable** property of Mapper into a printable String of our liking

The `let` function takes a lambda with one parameter and…

1. Provides its receiver to the lambda’s parameter
   Inside the lambda, the receiver can be used through the keyword `**it**`.
2. Calls the lambda and gets its result
   The code in the lambda **calculates a result** based on the receiver.
3. Returns the result of the lambda
   This allows the function to transform the receiver of type `T` into a value of type `R` that was returned by the lambda.

As we can see, there is no big difference between the usage of `run` or `let`.

We should prefer to use `let` when

- The receiver is a **nullable** *property of a class*. 
  In multi-threaded environments, a nullable property could be set to null just *after* a null-check but just *before* actually using it. This means that Kotlin can*not* guarantee null-safety even after `if (myNullableProperty == null) { ... }` is true. In this case, use `myNullableProperty**?.let** { ... }`, because the `it` inside the lambda will never be `null`.
- The receiver `this` inside the lambda of `run` may get confused with another `this` from an outer-scope or outer-class. In other words, if our code in the lambda would become unclear or too muddled, we may want to use `let`.

### Use ‘with’ to avoid writing the same receiver over and over again

```
inline fun <T, R> with(receiver: T, block: T.() -> R): R
```

```kotlin
class RemoteReceiver {
    fun remoteControl(id: String) : RemoteControl = TODO()
    
    fun turnOnAction(remoteControlId: String) : Unit {
        val remoteControl = remoteControl(remoteControlId)
        with(remoteControl) {
            turnOnAV()
            selectInput(HDMI_IN_2)
            selectOutput(HDMI_OUT_1)
            selectDSP(PASSTHROUGH)
            setVolume(-20.0)                   
        }
    }
    
}
```

```

```

Use ‘with’ to avoid writing ‘remoteControl.’ over and over again

The `with` function is like the `run` function but it doesn’t have a receiver. Instead, it takes a ‘receiver’ as its first parameter and the lambda-with-receiver as its second parameter. The function…

1. Provides its first parameter to the lambda’s receiver
   Inside the lambda, the receiver can be used through the optional keyword `**this**`.
2. Calls the lambda and get its result
   We no longer need to **write the same receiver over and over again**because the receiver is represented by the *optional* keyword `this`.
3. Returns the result of the lambda
   Although the receiver of type `T` is transformed into a value of type `R` , the **return value** of a `with` function **is usually ignored**.

### Use ‘run’ or ‘with’ for calling a function with multiple receivers

Earlier we discussed the concept of a *receiver* in Kotlin. An object not only can have one receiver, an object can have **two receivers**. For a function with two receivers, one receiver is the object for which this instance function is implemented, the other receiver is extended by the function.

Here’s an example where `adjustVolume` is a function with multiple (two) receivers:

```kotlin
interface AudioSource {
    val volume : Double
}

class AVReceiver(private val baseVolume: Double) {
    fun AudioSource.adjustVolume() : Double = 
        this@AVReceiver.baseVolume + this@adjustVolume.volume
}

fun main() {
    val audioSource = object: AudioSource { // Is extended by 'adjustVolume'
        override val volume = 20.0
    }
    
    val avReceiver = AVReceiver(-4.0) // The context in which 'adjustVolume' will be called
    
    val outputVolume1 : Double 
    val outputVolume2 : Double
    
    outputVolume1 = avReceiver.run { audioSource.adjustVolume() }
    
    with(avReceiver) { 
        outputVolume2 = audioSource.adjustVolume() 
    }
    
    println("$outputVolume1 and $outputVolume2")
}
```

```kotlin
16.0 and 16.0
```

In the above example of `adjustVolume`, `this@AVReceiver` is the instance-receiver and `this@adjustVolume` is the extended-receiver for the`AudioSource`.

The instance-receiver is often called the **context**. In our example, the extension-function `adjustVolume` for an `AudioSource` can be called **in the context of** an `AVReceiver`.

We know how to call a function on a single receiver. Just write `**receiver**.myFunction(param1, param2)` or something similar. But how can we provide not one but *two* receivers? This is where `run` and `with` can help.

Using `run` or `with`, we can call a receiver’s extension-function in the *context*of another receiver. The *context* is determined by the receiver of `run`, or the first parameter of `with`.

```kotlin
interface AudioSource {
    val volume : Double
}

class AVReceiver(private val baseVolume: Double) {
    fun AudioSource.adjustVolume() : Double = 
        this@AVReceiver.baseVolume + this@adjustVolume.volume
}

fun main() {
    val audioSource = object: AudioSource { // Is extended by 'adjustVolume'
        override val volume = 20.0
    }
    
    val avReceiver = AVReceiver(-4.0) // The context in which 'adjustVolume' will be called
    
    val outputVolume1 : Double 
    val outputVolume2 : Double
    
    outputVolume1 = avReceiver.run { audioSource.adjustVolume() }
    
    with(avReceiver) { 
        outputVolume2 = audioSource.adjustVolume() 
    }
    
    println("$outputVolume1 and $outputVolume2")
```

```kotlin
16.0 and 16.0
```

The ‘adjustVolume’ is called on an AudioSource in the context of an AVReceiver

### Quick Recap



The return values and how the receivers are referenced in the lambda

The function `apply` configures or builds objects

The function `also` executes side-effects on objects

The function `run` transforms its receiver into a value of another type

The function `let` transforms a nullable property of a class into a value of another type

The function `with` helps you avoid writing the same receiver over and over again

#### - Bonus Points -

There are few more Standard Library Kotlin functions defined besides the five we talked about just now. Here is a short list of the other ones:

`inline fun **TODO**(reason: String = " ... ") : Nothing` 
*Todo* throws an exception with the provided, but optional, `reason`. If we forget to implement a piece of code and don’t remove this *todo*, our app may crash.

`inline fun **repeat**(times: Int, action: (Int) -> Unit): Unit`
*Repeat* calls the provided `action` a given number of `times`. We can write less code using `repeat` instead of a `for` loop.

`inline fun <T> T.**takeIf**(predicate: (T) -> Boolean) : T?` 
*TakeIf* returns the receiver if the `predicate` returns **true**, otherwise it returns `null`. It is an alternative to an `if (...)`expression.

`inline fun <T> T.**takeUnless**(predicate: (T) -> Boolean) : T?` 
*TakeUnless* returns the receiver if the `predicate` returns **false**, otherwise it returns `null`. It is an alternative to an `if(**!**...)` expression.

If we need to code something like `if (long...expression.predicate())`, we may need to repeat the long expression again in the *then* or *else* clause. Use *TakeIf* or *TakeUnless* to avoid this repetition.
