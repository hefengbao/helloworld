# DSL

**领域专用语言**（Domain Specific Language / DSL）

DSL stands for Domain Specefic Language, which is a type of programming language that cares mainly about the readability by enforcing the use of declarative code with minimal boilerprate (declare to use) instead of imperative code (explaining how to solve a problem) but as a drawback, it can be used only inside a specific context or domain.
